\title{Partial correlation of probability scale residuals (PSRs)}
\usage{
partial.corPSRs(modX, modY, likelihood = "partial")
}
\arguments{
\item{modX}{Survival model object (see examples below) for event X generated by either semi-parametric survival models using \code{coxph()} and \code{cph()}, or parametric survival models using \code{survreg()} with argument \code{dist} set to one of the following: weilbull, exponential, loglogistic, and lognormal.}

\item{modY}{Survival model object (see examples below) for event Y generated by either semi-parametric survival models using \code{coxph()} and \code{cph()}, or parametric survival models using \code{survreg()} with argument \code{dist} set to one of the following: weilbull, exponential, loglogistic, and lognormal.}

\item{likelihood}{This argument is only used when the Cox regression is fitted. When \code{likelihood = "partial"} then the confidence interval is computed using M-estimation with partial likelihood. When \code{likelihood = "full"} then the full likelihood is used.}
}
\value{
The point estimate and \code{0.95\%} confidence interval computed using M-estimation.
}
\description{
Partial correlation of probability scale residuals (PSRs).
}
\details{
When fitting Cox proportional hazards model for continuous data (especially simulated data),
argument \code{timefix=TRUE} of \code{coxph()} or \code{cph()} needs to be set to \code{FALSE}
to avoid the 'detection' of spurious ties. When \code{likelihood = "partial"}
then the variance is estimated disregarding the variability of the baseline hazard.
When \code{likelihood = "full"} then the variability of the baseline hazard
is taken into account. However, using the full likelihood has two limitations.
First, the dimension of the M-estimation matrices may grow with the number
of observations, \code{n}, which means that the computational complexity
is quadratic,\code{n^2}. Second, the M-estimation matrices may
turn out to be singular, in which case, the function throws
a warning and uses the partial likelihood.
When using \code{cph()}, arguments \code{x} and \code{y} have to be set to \code{TRUE}.

In general, the value of the partial correlation cannot be greater than 1 or less than -1. However,
the confidence intervals are not altered to fit this restriction so the
user can see the magnitude of partial correlation variability.

   modX = survreg(survObjX ~ Z, dist = "loglogistic")
   modY = survreg(survObjY ~ Z, dist = "loglogistic")
